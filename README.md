# Semantic Form Editor

This project is a practical part of a master thesis called the Semantic Form Editor at FEE CTU in Prague.

The Semantic Form Editor is now a functioning prototype that can be used by form designers creating  smart  ontology-based  forms.   The  created  forms  can  be  validated against current form design best-practices using SHACL validation constraints.
